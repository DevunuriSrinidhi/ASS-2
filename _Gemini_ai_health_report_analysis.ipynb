            "**1. WIDAL TEST:** This test checks for antibodies against *Salmonella Typhi* and *Salmonella Paratyphi*, bacteria that cause typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever.  The numbers (e.g., 1:160, 1:80, 1:20) represent the dilution of the sample. Higher numbers suggest a higher likelihood of infection, but interpretation needs clinical context.  In this case, only S.Typhi \"O\" shows a result higher than the reference range.  It's not definitively conclusive of active typhoid.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "**2. DENGUE SEROLOGY:** This checks for dengue fever.  NS1 Antigen, IgG, and IgM are all negative. This means the tests didn't detect evidence of a current or past dengue infection.  Negative results are good news, indicating no dengue infection detected.\n",
            "\n",
            "**3. ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate):** This measures how quickly red blood cells settle at the bottom of a test tube. A higher ESR can indicate inflammation or infection in the body. Mr. Goud's ESR is elevated (26 mm/hr in the first hour, 52 mm/hr in the second), suggesting possible inflammation.\n",
            "\n",
            "**4. RAPID MALARIA TEST:** This is a quick test to detect malaria parasites in the blood. Both *Plasmodium falciparum* (P.F) and *Plasmodium vivax* (P.V) are negative, meaning no malaria was detected.\n",
            "\n",
            "**5. COMPLETE BLOOD PICTURE (CBC):** This is a comprehensive blood test:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Hemoglobin (Hb):**  Measures the amount of oxygen-carrying protein in the blood.  Mr. Goud's level (13.6 gms%) is within the normal range.\n",
            "* **RBC (Red Blood Cell count):** The number of red blood cells. His count (4.3 mill/cumm) is slightly low but within the range for some individuals.\n",
            "* **WBC (White Blood Cell count):**  The number of white blood cells (part of the immune system).  His count (7,200 cells/cumm) is within the normal range.\n",
            "* **Platelet count:**  These cells help with blood clotting. His count (2.0 lakhs/cumm) is within the normal range.\n",

            "* **Peripheral Blood Smear:** Examination of the blood under a microscope;  results indicate normal red and white blood cell morphology and adequate platelets.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "**6. HbA1c:** This test measures average blood sugar levels over the past 2-3 months.  Mr. Goud's level (5.4%) falls within the normal range for someone who is not diabetic.\n",
            "\n",
            "**7. SERUM CREATININE:** This measures creatinine, a waste product from muscle breakdown, in the blood. It helps assess kidney function. His level (0.8 mg/dl) is within the normal range.\n",
            "\n",
            "**8. RANDOM BLOOD GLUCOSE:** This measures blood sugar at a random time. His level (not given in the report, only the range is given).\n",

            "* **Alkaline Phosphatase:** An enzyme found in the liver and bones; elevated levels may suggest liver or bone disease. Mr. Goud's level is within the normal range.\n",
            "* **SGOT (AST) and SGPT (ALT):**  Enzymes found in the liver; elevated levels can indicate liver damage.  Both are within the normal range.\n",
            "* **Total Protein and Albumin:** These are proteins in the blood; levels can indicate liver or kidney problems.  Both are within the normal range.\n",
            "* **Globulin:** Another blood protein; the ratio of albumin to globulin (A/G ratio) is also within the normal range.\n",
            "\n",
